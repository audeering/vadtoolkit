VAD Toolkit: A Database for Voice Activity Detection

At each environment, conversational speech by two Korean male speakers
was recorded. The ground truth labels are manually annotated. Because the recording
was carried out in the real world, unexpected noises are included to the dataset
such as the crying of baby, the chirping of insects, mouse click sound, and etc..
